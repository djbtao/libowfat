0.15:
  man page update (document stralloc return values)
  add stralloc_chop and stralloc_chomp
  add buffer_putsa, buffer_get_token_sa and buffer_getline_sa
  extended uudecode test.  See comment at top for details.
  fix #include in ndelay*.3 (Hynek Schlawack)
  add stralloc_diff and stralloc_diffs (my invention)
  scan_ip6 returned 1 for "::" (Uwe Ohse)
  add el-cheapo MIME decoding to test/uudecode
  make install forgot to install ndelay.h
  fix typo in dns_mx man page (Hynek Schlawack)

0.14:
  avoid bus errors in byte_copy
  byte_rchr was completely broken
  add case, iopause, tai, taia, openreadclose and ipv6-enhanced dns

0.13:
  fixed several bugs in test/uudecode.c
  add uninstall target
  add uint16_read API like the uint32_read one
  add buffer_putnlflush
  lots of general clean-ups from Jukka Zitting:
    add FMT_LONG to fmt.h (FMT_ULONG plus 1 for sign)
    fmt_strn did not work for out==NULL
    fix inconsistencies in man pages
  make scan_urlencode do the '+' -> ' ' transformation

0.12:
  add textcode api for uuencode/uudecode, base64, quoted printable,
    url-encoding and yenc.

0.11:
  fix fmt_long (didn't count the '-'), which in turn broke
    buffer_putlong
  referenced wrong include file in stralloc_ready and stralloc_readyplus
    man page.

0.10:
  add comment to stralloc.h that explains the structure (Markus Brischke)
  fix socket routines (two cut-and-paste errors)

0.9:
  fmt_str did not check for out==NULL!  Thanks, Uwe Ohse.
  Updated to buffer to fix read buffers.  Thanks, David Lichteblau.
  Oops!  byte_copy had a trivial and dumb typo in it that I'm unsure how
    I could have missed it.
  add mmap man pages.
  update and add socket man pages.
  don't include str.h from fmt.h
  document error signalling for the mmap functions.

0.8:
  BSD compatibility.
  fix mmap_shared.
  ranlib.
  s/EPROTO/EPROTONOSUPPORT/.

0.7:
  add buffer_putspace
  fix b0read prototype in buffer/buffer_0*
  scan_ip6 will not transparently scan IPv4 addresses and save them as
    v4-mapped addresses (::ffff:127.0.0.1).
  byte_copy was sped up (but made larger in the process)

0.6:
  changed name to libowfat.
  fixed fmt_ulong (did not output 0 correctly).
  added buffer.
  extended buffer API to include buffer_putulong() and friends.
  oops, the read buffering was completely broken!
  add mmap library (idea from Ingo Oeser)

0.5:
  made subdirectories for the different libraries.
  moved the sources into the corresponding subdirectory.
  imported my man pages from libdjb.
  removed fmt_int.c and fmt_uint.c (they are macros in fmt.h).
  corrected comment in open.h for open_excl.
  wrote new man pages for fmt_double, scan_double, the sign fmt_ and
    scan_ routines, the whitespace and charset scan_ routines, and the
    str and stralloc routines.

0.4:
  implemented stralloc.

0.3:
  implemented uint16, uint32 and uint64.  The header files try to
    define shortcut endianness conversion routines that do not convert
    anything.
  implemented open (I hope I got open_excl right, I couldn't find an
    implementationen).

0.2:
  implemented the scan, fmt and str interfaces.
  added adapted fmt_double and scan_double from diet libc.

0.1:
  initial release.
  implemented the byte interface.
