0.6:
  changed name to libowfat.
  fixed fmt_ulong (did not output 0 correctly).
  added buffer.
  extended buffer API to include buffer_putulong() and friends.
  oops, the read buffering was completely broken!
  add mmap library (idea from Ingo Oeser)

0.5:
  made subdirectories for the different libraries.
  moved the sources into the corresponding subdirectory.
  imported my man pages from libdjb.
  removed fmt_int.c and fmt_uint.c (they are macros in fmt.h).
  corrected comment in open.h for open_excl.
  wrote new man pages for fmt_double, scan_double, the sign fmt_ and
    scan_ routines, the whitespace and charset scan_ routines, and the
    str and stralloc routines.

0.4:
  implemented stralloc.

0.3:
  implemented uint16, uint32 and uint64.  The header files try to
    define shortcut endianness conversion routines that do not convert
    anything.
  implemented open (I hope I got open_excl right, I couldn't find an
    implementationen).

0.2:
  implemented the scan, fmt and str interfaces.
  added adapted fmt_double and scan_double from diet libc.

0.1:
  initial release.
  implemented the byte interface.
