.TH buffer_getline 3
.SH NAME
buffer_getline \- read line from buffer
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <buffer.h>

int \fBbuffer_getline\fP(buffer* \fIb\fR,char* \fIx\fR,unsigned int \fIlen\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
buffer_getline copies data from \fIb\fR to \fIx\fR[0], \fIx\fR[1], ...,
\fIx\fR[\fIlen\fR-1] until \fIlen\fR bytes have been copied or a
new-line character ('\\n') is encountered.  That character is also
copied.

buffer_getline returns the number of bytes read (excluding the '\\n') or
-1 on error (setting \fIerrno\fR appropriately).

Note that line is not 0-terminated to make reading lines with 0-bytes
possible through this interface.
