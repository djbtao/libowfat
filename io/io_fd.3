.TH io_fd 3
.SH NAME
io_fd \- prepare descriptor for io_wait
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <io.h>

void \fBio_fd\fP(int64 fd);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If you want to use io_canread() and io_canwrite() on a descriptor, you
have to use io_wait() on it first, and io_wait() has to know which
descriptors you are interested in.  Use io_fd() for this.

io_pipe and io_socketpair already call io_fd for you.

Waiting on descriptors only works for sockets, fifos and pipes.  It may
also work on devices and TTYs, but that is platform dependent -- you
should not rely on that.  It does not work on files.
